### **Basic Carving**

Chisels and hammers met rock as artisans embarked on the fundamental stage of carving. Columns took shape, doorways emerged, and the essence of Nabataean funeral facades materialized before their eyes. The tactile nature of this process connected them to the hands of ancient artisans, whose craft shaped the very soul of Hegra.

### **Detailing and Symbolism**

Now came the time for intricacy. Symbolic representations, religious motifs, and scenes depicting the departed graced the facade. Each detail told a story, a glimpse into the beliefs and narratives that defined Nabataean culture. The carved tributes became vessels of remembrance, preserving the essence of lives long past.

### **Finishing Touches**

Smooth surfaces beckoned their touch as artisans refined the carved elements. The weathering effects they applied were deliberate, echoing the patina of time that graced authentic Nabataean facades. The creations, though new, bore the weathered wisdom of centuries past, a testament to the enduring craftsmanship of their makers.

### **Preservation Measures**

To safeguard their tributes against the ravages of time and weather, carved into the topmost shelf of the tomb would ssit a water channel. Rainfall would drain down the sides, leaving the facade to endue the test of time. Preservation became a pledge to the future, ensuring that the echoes of the past resonated through time.

### **Reflection on the Artistic Process**

The challenges faced by ancient craftsmen became apparent, and the enduring legacy of their craftsmanship resonated through the ages. Nabataean funeral facades, once silent witnesses to the passage of time, now echo with the voices of those who dared to carve their legacies in stone. These carved facades stand not merely as monuments but as tributes to a civilization that carved its identity into the very soul of the earth, a legacy etched in stone for eternity.

## The History of Hegra

Evidence of human presence at Hegra dates back to beyond the 1st millennium BCE and was the location of the Nabataean city from the end of the 1st millennium BCE into the 1st millennium CE. Inscriptions detailing who was buried within remain above some of these breathtaking burial chambers to this day. These tombs were dedicated to healers, military figures, local leaders and others.

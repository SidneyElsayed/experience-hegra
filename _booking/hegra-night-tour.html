<section class="grid padded mob-padded-lg">
    <h3>What to Expect</h3>
    <p class="editable">Saudi is well known for its hospitality, which they are excited to share. From the moment you step into the Visitor Center, you'll be welcomed with an array of drinks and treats. Depending on the season, this could be fresh juices or Saudi coffee, water, dried fruits and always a few dates. Most of the tour guides, known as Rawis (singular: raw-wee), are from AlUla or the surrounding area. Each guide is accompanied by a Ranger, who is there to ensure visitors respect the heritage sites.</p>
    <p class="editable">Your Rawi will through the area of Hegra, bringing you to various designated sites either by carriage or by bicycle. At each stop, they will explain different details of the tombs, carvings and more. The tour generally includes the following:</p>
    <div class="margin-l margin-b-1">
        <ul>
            <li>Jabal Ahmar</li>
            <li>Tomb of Lihyan son of Kuza</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="editable">*Some sites may be under renovation/restoration at the time of your visit - parts of Hegra are still being discovered, which is what makes it an exciting time to visit.</p>

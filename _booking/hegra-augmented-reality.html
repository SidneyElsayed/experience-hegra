overview: AlUla sits significantly on the ancient Incense Road, a magical oasis for weary travellers, pilgrims and locals alike. Many kingdoms once called AlUla home, leaving traces of their way of life, inscribing their stories into the sandstone rockfaces and carving intricate tombs among the mountains.

    <h3>What to Expect</h3>
    <p class="editable">This augmented reality tour brings the ancient Nabataean civilization to life with special ARtGlass technologies. Climb aboard your own private vintage Land Rover and see a side of Hegra not many have seen before.</p>
    <p class="editable">A designated driver will take you through the area of Hegra, bringing you to various sites. Most of the tour guides, known as Rawis (singular: raw-wee), are from AlUla or the surrounding area. Each guide is accompanied by a Ranger, who is there to ensure visitors respect the heritage sites. Your Rawi will explain different details of the tombs, carvings and more. The tour generally includes the following:</p>
    <div class="margin-l margin-b-1">
        <ul>
            <li>Jabal Ahmar</li>
            <li>Tomb of Lihyan son of Kuza</li>
            <li>Jabal Banat</li>
            <li>Jabal Ithlib</li>
            <li>Handcraft Pavilion</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="editable">*Some sites may be under renovation/restoration at the time of your visit - parts of Hegra are still being discovered, which is what makes it an exciting time to visit.</p>

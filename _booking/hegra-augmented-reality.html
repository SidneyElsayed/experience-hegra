overview: AlUla sits significantly on the ancient Incense Road, a magical oasis for weary travellers, pilgrims and locals alike.

    <h3>What to Expect</h3>
    <p>This augmented reality tour brings the ancient Nabataean civilization to life with special ARtGlass technologies. Climb aboard your own private vintage Land Rover and see a side of Hegra not many have seen before.</p>
    <p>A designated driver will take you through the area of Hegra, bringing you to various sites. Most of the tour guides, known as Rawis (singular: raw-wee), are from AlUla or the surrounding area. Each guide is accompanied by a Ranger, who is there to ensure visitors respect the heritage sites. Your Rawi will explain different details of the tombs, carvings and more. The tour generally includes the following:</p>
    <div class="margin-l margin-b-1">
        <ul>
            <li>Jabal Ahmar</li>
            <li>Tomb of Lihyan son of Kuza</li>
            <li>Jabal Banat</li>
            <li>Jabal Ithlib</li>
            <li>Handcraft Pavilion</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>*Some sites may be under renovation/restoration at the time of your visit - parts of Hegra are still being discovered, which is what makes it an exciting time to visit.</p>

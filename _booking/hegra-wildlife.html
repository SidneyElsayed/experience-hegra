    <h3>What to Expect</h3>
    <p class="editable">This unique tour takes a completely different look at Hegra, one from the perspective of the flora and fauna of the area. Hegra is protected, an expansive space where plants and other wildlife have been free to thrive in their natural habitat. This tour gets you off the beaten path to explore the farther reaches of this UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p>
